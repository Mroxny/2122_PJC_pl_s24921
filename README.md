# Creatures_TheGame

"Creatures" is a simple Text game project made in C++.<br/>


Description
====

The rules are simple.
First, choose six creatures.
Each of the creatures has its own attributes and special powers:
* HP - the health of the creature
* Strength - determines how much damage a creature can deal
* Skill - Defines the percentage of avoiding an attack

Then start the fight with the opponent.
You only have one move for each turn:
* Attack
* Use of a special ability
* Character upgrade
* Change the Current Creation


Enjoy!
