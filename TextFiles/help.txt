The rules are simple.
First, choose six creatures.
Each of the creatures has its own attributes and special powers:
    - HP - the health of the creature
    - Strength - determines how much damage a creature can deal
    - Skill - Defines the percentage of avoiding an attack
Then start the fight with the opponent.
You only have one move for each turn:
    - Attack
    - Use of a special ability
    - Character upgrade
    - Change the Current Creation

Different types of characters interact differently:
